## Summary

Full-stack generalist built for small tactical teams that deliver results through direct action, not buy-in. Grew from embedded firmware for wildlife tracking and acoustic positioning through test equipment, factory automation, and into software architecture for embodied AI. Spans firmware, electronics, CAD, production test, 3D/video/media production, and modern software stacks. Uses AI to move from zero to working systems quickly, then hardens into maintainable infrastructure—working prototype first, refactor second, test automation third, then structured handoff so team members can own subsystems without needing to understand the whole architecture. Favors edge-first to reduce cloud costs while maintaining cloud capabilities for fleet-scale coordination.

## Experience

### Business Owner — Valpatel Software LLC • Dublin, CA • Dec 2025–Present
Building Graphlings, a privacy-first AI platform disguised as games—testing and shaping AI agents through play. Architecture mirrors robotics fleet management: device discovery, state monitoring, workflow orchestration, tiered AI. Built and manage 12-node compute cluster (Jetsons, VPS, local servers) with solar power, battery backup, and triple-redundant internet.

### Co-Founder — GraphDone • Dublin, CA • Aug 2025–Present
Building free and open source, inclusive project management tools for neurodivergent developers—visualizing dependencies and flows instead of ticket-based workflows, with real AI integration.

### Software Architect — Monarch Tractor • Livermore, CA • May 2025–Nov 2025
Led MonarchOne software-defined product ecosystem. Built base software for system monitoring, container discovery, and product profile launch.

### Manager, Electrical Test Engineering — Monarch Tractor • Livermore, CA • Apr 2024–May 2025
Developed test and metrics software to automate testing of mobile industrial robots. Built dozens of containerized tools with consistent frontend/backend architecture; created brand design system from marketing collaboration. Managed 20+ networked systems across Tailscale VPN.

### Senior Electrical Test Engineer — Monarch Tractor • Livermore, CA • Jun 2022–Apr 2024
Built production PCBA test automation, fault injection hardware, and InfluxDB-based observability connecting vehicles, HITL rigs, dynos, and factory equipment. Designed assemblies for thermal propagation mitigation research.

### Avionics Test Engineer → Senior → Staff — Astra • Alameda, CA • Mar 2019–Jun 2022 (3.3 yrs)
Designed and built avionics functional testers, HITL simulators, and environmental test fixtures (shaker, thermal vacuum with LN2). Created PXI-based rocket engine test interface boards in DIN enclosures (~50 units), cutting weeks from new test stand setup. Specialized in circuit board and sheet metal enclosure design.

### Prototype Engineer — Skyryse • Hayward, CA • Oct 2018–Mar 2019 (6 mos)
Designed and manufactured autopilot debug hardware to enable software fixes. Company relocated to LA.

### Engineering Technician, Battery & Powertrain — Joby Aviation • Redwood City, CA • Jan 2018–Sep 2018 (9 mos)
Supported aircraft battery and power-train teams. Designed carbon fiber composite shaker head expander. Conducted destructive battery thermal runaway testing; selected respirators and implemented safety protocols for hazardous testing.

### Engineering Technician IV → Associate Test Engineer — Tesla • Fremont, CA • Apr 2014–Jan 2018 (3.8 yrs)
Built electrical test racks; progressed to designing pogo pin fixtures and production tooling. Modified C++ flashing software for multi-device workflows; developed subassembly testers for vehicle general assembly. Escalated to Elon to help secure $200K+ total budget for lab equipment: dual Epilog laser cutters, CNC mill, German wire processing machines, 3D printers. Trained teams on equipment use.

### Production Engineer — OpenROV • Berkeley, CA • Nov 2013–May 2014 (7 mos)
Underwater robot hardware development and PCB design for testing.

### Partner and VP Engineering — Desert Star Systems • Marina, CA • Sep 2008–Jan 2013 (4.4 yrs)
Started in embedded firmware (C on MSP430), expanded into PC software (C#) and electronic hardware for underwater tracking. Wrote SeaDock, SeaTrack, and SeaWatch software for wildlife tag control. Helped acquire SBIR, STTR, and NOAA research contracts. Established in-house rapid prototyping.
